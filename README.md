# Flashcards

## Context
The study flashcards that everyone knows and loves, now in virtual form. 

## User
Anyone who needs to study/memorize some material would be a user of this application. 

## Use 
This application is meant to organize your study material, and to allow you to study using a method that people traditionally find to be quite effective. 

## Features
* Forms that allow you to:
    * Add new cards to decks
    * Edit old cards
    * Create new decks
    * Edit old decks
* A study component that lets you flip through your cards, displaying both the front and back sides of each card before moving on to the next. 

## Technologies Used
* React 
   * useState
   * useEffect 
   * react-router-dom
   * Event listeners (mainly click and submission handlers)
* Bootstrap 
    * Buttons
    * Forms 
    
## Discoveries 
This project gave me a lot more familiarity with react. Specifically, I got a lot more comfortable using the useEffect() hook and routing. I also got to practice some asynchronous JS (in the form of API calls).

## Future Goals 
I would like to return to this project and organize the components better. I also feel that I may have created some unecessary components that make things bulky-- it might be worth it to see about merging these with more the necessary components.
